<h1>JobAPP</h1>

<p>I developed a JOBApp using React-Toolkit features.
I enabled transitions between 2 different pages with React-Router-Dom features. You can add a new job or remove it from the list by entering the Position-Compnay-Statu-Type properties. It can filter with the entered properties. You can use the quick search features. The project has a responsive structure.</p>
